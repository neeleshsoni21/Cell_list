***************************
Installation and Execution
***************************


Option 1: To install cell_list as independent module. (RECOMMENDED)

**************
Installation:
**************
For all users (needs root password)

cd cell_list_v4.2_package
sudo python3.4 setup.py install

For current user only
python3.4 setup.py install --user


Note: you may need to install setuptools if not provided by default
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

*************************************************
Testing the Installtion with default parameters:
*************************************************
import cell_list as cl
distance_list=cl.cell_list()

==================================================
Successful run should print similar to this:

Reading file:  /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/cell_list_v4.2-3.2-py3.4.egg/cell_list/input/1QJA.pdb

Mesh with following no of mesh points in (x,y,z) created:  ( 10 11 10 )
Mesh Origin:  ( -16.773 , -39.231 , 8.043 )
Length of square cell/cutoff:  8.0
Total no of cells:  1100 

Calculating distances...

Writing the output file...

Time elapsed =  2.74687600136 s
==================================================


**************************************
Executing the cell_list in your code:
**************************************
import cell_list as cl
distance_list=cl.cell_list(<inputfile>, <outputfile>, <cutoff>, <atomtypes>, <residuetypes>)

where 
<inputfile> is the input pdb file 
<outputfile> is the output file for output
<cutoff> is the cutoff provided to the cell list algorithm 
<atomtypes> is the list of atom types. "ALL" (for all atomtypes) or "CA CB CG" (for specific atomtypes)
<residuetypes> is the list of residue types. "ALL" (for all residue types) or "LYS ARG HIS" (for specific residue types)





Option 2: To run cell_list independenly (NOT RECOMMENDED). For developers only
cd cell_list_v4.2_package/cell_list
bash run_cell_list.sh

You can change the execution parameters in the run_cell_list.sh file
