Cell_list is a tool for finding all the neighbors of any atoms within some cutoff distance efficiently. This tool uses “cell list algorithm” whose time complexity order of N (Θ(N)). This tool is especially helpful for large proteins where one has to find the neighbors repeatedly. Determining the neighbors could be required at many places, for instance, for calculating the atomic clashes between atoms, for calculating the electrostatic energy for a set of dynamic atoms etc.
